# Pair Programming

## Learning Goals

- Use pair programing to solve an algorithm problem
- Practice pair programming techniques

## Introduction

We recommend completing this exercise in weeks 2 or 3 of Phase 3.

For this activity, you will pair up and complete a challenge from this Phase
pair-programming style! In other words, one of you will be the driver and the
other will be the navigator, and then you will switch. Remember to be patient
with one another and to keep the lines of communication open. If one of you
becomes quiet for an extended period of time, ask a question to help keep things
moving.

## Instructions

- Choose a problem from this Phase that you were unable to solve, have not tried
  yet, or struggled with a lot
- If you are the navigator, you will guide the driver by doing the following:
  - Communicate in simple and small steps what code should be written
  - Explain why you're making those decisions
  - Inform the driver when they're misunderstanding your directions or are
    making syntactical errors
  - Point out any improvements that can be made to the code
  - If time allows and problem has been solved, guide the driver through a
    refactor to improve the code
- If you are the driver, you will write code according to the navigator's instructions:
  - Ask questions when you don't understand the what or the why
  - If you disagree with a decision, diplomatically state your disagreement and why
  - Be the typist
  - Stay focused on the current task
